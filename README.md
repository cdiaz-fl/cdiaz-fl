I was a graphic designer and advertising lover. All I ever wanted was to be part of a creative agency. I've studied hard for years to achieve that dream and once I was able to make it real, the industry didn't match my expectations. 

It was at that moment when I discovered an educative project that seduced me from the very first time: 42. And my life had a plot twist.

I've never seen myself coding. I believed it just wasn't my cup of tea. However, it didn't take me too much time to realize that advertising and coding weren't that different. Both are fields where you need your imagination to create something from scratch.

That's why I began to use GitHub. To create... and create... and create...
